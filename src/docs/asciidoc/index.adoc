== Introduction
This tool is used to upload data to the KPMP Data Lake.

== View Packages
This will retrieve the list of packages that have been stored in Mongo and return the basic information
to be displayed to the user.

== Upload Package
The process to upload a package contains three steps.
  
=== Step 1 - Upload package metadata

==== Sample Request
include::{snippets}/uploadPackageInfo/http-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/uploadPackageInfo/request-fields.adoc[]

The response is the generated id for the package.

=== Step 2 - Upload the files
We support chunking of file uploads. If you have multiple files, you will need to call this for each file you wish to add to the package.

==== Sample Request
include::{snippets}/postFileToPackage/http-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/postFileToPackage/request-parameters.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/postFileToPackage/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Sample Response
include::{snippets}/postFileToPackage/http-response.adoc[]

=== Step 3 - Finish the package upload
Calling this will generate the zip file to allow the package to be downloaded.  Without this call, the package will not be available for download.

==== Sample Request
include::{snippets}/finishPackage/http-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/finishPackage/path-parameters.adoc[]

==== Sample Response
include::{snippets}/finishPackage/http-response.adoc[]
