#Process Large File Upload

If installing this on a new server, first you will need to run npm install in order to get the appropriate packages to update mongo.

Since this process could take a long time to complete, you will likely want to run it in screen.

Then, just run processLargeFileUpload and provide the packageId you want to process when it prompts you.

Pay attention to the output to see if it was sucessful.
